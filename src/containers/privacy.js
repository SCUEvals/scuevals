          <p>
            The only cookies in use on our site are for Google Analytics, Oauth 2.0 for Google, and a
            JSON web token which is deleted after signing out for serverside verification containing information
            given while creating your account (major, graduation year, and gender). Google Analytics is
            a tool that helps us understand how visitors interact with our website. Oauth 2.0 allows users
            to securely login through Google's services without us managing or having access to
            passwords. We use this so we may ensure those who wish to post reviews are from Santa Clara
            University while keeping you secure. We also have access to Google Analytics's 3rd-party
            audience data to better understand the demographics of our users.

          <p>We do not store nor have access to your personal passwords.</p>

            Google Analytics collects information anonymously. It reports website trends
            without identifying individual visitors.  To learn more about Google Analytics
