### How do I get set up? ###

* For the first time, open command line in the root directory. Type "npm install". This will install all node modules that are dependencies listed in package.json.
* Each time on startup, run in command line "npm start", a custom script.
* After the command is complete, open a browser and type into the browser "localhost:8080".
